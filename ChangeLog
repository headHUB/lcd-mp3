03-04-2015	Find better way for debouncing buttons; maybe have to do in hardware.
03-04-2015	Changed shutdown/halt option (now you have to add -halt) Also tried to fix scrolling text
delay.  Song file names with spaces seem to work; wonder what else is wrong.
- found odd bug; sometimes when paused, and is then unpaused the text gets glitchy.
31-01-2015	Setting up for final project.
Things to be done:
- Remove all ncurses / terminal output
- Change -dir and -songs to -d and -s and --dir= and --songs=
- song file names that have a space kill this... find out why
- On startup, (assuming the /etc/fstab has already mounted a USB drive (/dev/sda1)
to /MUSIC) check /MUSIC and load in all music.
- if Quit button is pressed, display "QUIT - Shutdown" and "PAUSE - Cancel"
27-01-2015	Removed the LEDs from below...
25-01-2015	Added some LEDs to also indicate when paused and if info is on or not
07-12-2014	Added the PAUSED text to the LCD when paused and disabled all other buttons while paused.

02-12-2014	Removed everything regarding debouncing function; going back to old delay setup
